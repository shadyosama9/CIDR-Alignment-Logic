## ðŸ“˜ CIDR Alignment Logic (Using /24 Blocks as Base)

This guide helps you determine:

* How many IPs are in a CIDR block
* How many `/24`s it spans
* Which octet is affected
* What the octet must be divisible by

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: **Calculate Total Hosts**

```
Total Hosts = 2^(32 - CIDR)
```

> Total number of usable IP addresses in the block.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: **Calculate Number of /24 Blocks**

```
Number of /24s = Total Hosts / 256 = 2^(24 - CIDR)
```

> A `/24` contains 256 IPs, so divide total IPs by 256.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: **Determine Affected Octet**

Based on how many `/24`s the block spans:

| Condition                   | Affected Octet |
| --------------------------- | -------------- |
| `/24s â‰¤ 256`                | 3rd or 4th     |
| `/24s > 256` (â‰¥ 1 full /16) | 2nd            |

> If you span more than 256 `/24`s, it crosses into multiple `/16`s, and thus the 2nd octet becomes affected.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: **Determine Required Divisibility**

#### âœ… Rule:

* If **/24 blocks â‰¤ 256**:
  â†’ Use the number **as-is** (no division)
  â†’ This applies to **3rd or 4th octet**

* If **/24 blocks > 256**:
  â†’ **Divide by 256** to find the step size
  â†’ This applies to **2nd octet**

#### ðŸ”§ Formula Summary:

```
If /24s â‰¤ 256:
    Required_Divisor = Number of /24s
If /24s > 256:
    Required_Divisor = Number of /24s Ã· 256
```

---

## âœ… Examples

### Example: `/19`

* Hosts = 2^13 = 8192
* `/24s` = 8192 / 256 = 32
* Affected Octet = 3rd
* Divisibility: **by 32** (no division)

### Example: `/13`

* Hosts = 2^19 = 524,288
* `/24s` = 524,288 / 256 = 2048
* Affected Octet = 2nd
* Divisibility: 2048 / 256 = 8

### Example: `/23`

* Hosts = 512
* `/24s` = 2
* Affected Octet = 4th
* Divisibility: by 2

## ðŸ§  TL;DR Table

| CIDR | Hosts  | /24s | Affected Octet | Divisible By |
| ---- | ------ | ---- | -------------- | ------------ |
| /24  | 256    | 1    | 4th            | 1            |
| /23  | 512    | 2    | 4th            | 2            |
| /20  | 4096   | 16   | 3rd            | 16           |
| /19  | 8192   | 32   | 3rd            | 32           |
| /16  | 65536  | 256  | 3rd            | 256          |
| /15  | 131072 | 512  | 2nd            | 2            |
| /13  | 524288 | 2048 | 2nd            | 8            |
| /11  | 2M+    | 8192 | 2nd            | 32           |
